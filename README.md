# Hello-World
First Project to Learn How github works
I started looking at learning python in my free time. After learning a good amount I decided to look around to see how I can gain some experience to apply what I learned about the python language. So I'll be looking around to learn more about github and expand on my python knowledge, and aslo other languages as well.
